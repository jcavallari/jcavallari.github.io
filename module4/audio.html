<caption>Elvira, Mistress of the Dark is a 1988 horror comedy film directed by James Signorelli and starring Cassandra Peterson as the titular Elvira, self-proclaimed Mistress of the Dark.

    The film follows Elvira’s quest to start a Las Vegas revue after she quits her job as a TV horror hostess. Receiving a letter that she has inherited her recently-deceased great aunt’s estate, she travels from Hollywood to the fictional town of Fallwell, Massachusetts to claim her inheritance and, hopefully, enough money to start her Las Vegas show. Trouble soon ensues when her campy humor and low-cut dress meet the conservative Fallwell town council and the nefarious designs of her great uncle Vincent.
    
    Receiving negative reviews on first release, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark has become a cult classic due to Peterson’s campy humor and a heartwarming take on the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold motif. If you’re looking for some low-key Halloween fun, this is the movie for you.
